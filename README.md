# Friday Night Funkin' - Magic Master Engine
This Engine started as a Modification of Kade Engine for a Mod, but as time went by it became a complete Modification of the Base Code with some new features for the Community.

This Engine is not intended as a Template to be used in mods.
We prefer that most mods for this Engine are created to be used from the Engine Mods folder.
